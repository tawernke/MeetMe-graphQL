# MeetMe

This is an app that will have the same functionality as an app I've already built, but using a GraphQL API instead of REST.

The calendar features of the app are fully functional, but using the Yelp GraphQL API is currently a work in progress.

## Built With

* React
* Node
* Apollo Client
* GraphQL Yoga
* Prisma
* [Yelp GraphQL API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/graphql/guides/intro)
* [FullCallendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) - A javascript callendar
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) - React UI component library
